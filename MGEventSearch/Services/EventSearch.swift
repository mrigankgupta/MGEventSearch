/* READ ME: - Please put the key for testing
 Can be improved:
    1. I have not written UT as it was not under the scope of instruction.
    Although code is written in a way that its pretty much testable Ready
    2. Assuming that UX is not in scope but details are. UI might be not 100% same as given in test link
    because I would require images as well as UX. Some images like placeholders are blurs as I
    did not find images in short time.
 Addressed
    1. Thin Network client with Error handling
    2. O(n) search for Favorite using dictionary */
